# password-manager

Simple desktop gui application to create random passwords for websites that you decide to store. After passwords are created they will be stored in a json file inside the project directory. There is a search box as well where you can search for the website if you have forgotten the password and an alert box will display the password. The password will be copied to the clipboard as well where you can paste the password directly into the website.
